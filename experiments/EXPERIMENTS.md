# Growth experiments

Rules: one variable per experiment · ≥5 videos per arm before reading results · correlation is not causation · never re-upload to reset an experiment.

## title-style — running

Hypothesis: Story-shaped titles ("The Bridge That…") earn more Shorts-feed views per video than question titles at 7 days.
Variable: title pattern · metric: `views_7d` · start: 2026-09-24

| Arm | Meaning | Videos |
|---|---|---|
| TITLE_STYLE_A | object-that / two-beat story title | PGOKZhPYo7c, DLYpmaQ-EVw |
| TITLE_STYLE_B | why/how question title | qkzRUqlEy5I, X0jw78mIGdk, ODZ7y6r1o6o, bqTpdauhlHo |

Result (insufficient data confidence): Not enough videos per arm (need ≥5; have TITLE_STYLE_A=2, TITLE_STYLE_B=2). No conclusion — and no causal claim.
