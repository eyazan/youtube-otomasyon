# Existing videos — migration plan

Generated 2026-09-24 by `node existing-video-optimizer.js --all`. Per-video detail: `analysis/<videoId>/optimization-report.md`.

Rules: never delete, never re-upload, never replace automatically. Change one packaging element at a time and log it in `experiments/experiments.json` so the effect can be measured.

Priority key: **P1** high impressions + low CTR · **P2** good views + low subscriber conversion · **P3** good retention + weak Suggested traffic · **P4** low-data videos.

### The Disaster That Ended the Age of the Airship
https://youtu.be/PGOKZhPYo7c · 978 views · diagnosis: OUTPERFORMER

- `KEEP` — outperforming the channel — keep title and thumbnail; only fix objective gaps below
- `REDESCRIBE` — no footage/source attribution; no technical references; no related-episode or playlist link (session growth); no synthetic-voice disclosure line
- `REVIEW_MANUALLY` — Published narration states a spark ignited leaking gas as fact; it is the leading theory (static discharge), not proven. The pinned comment/description should say "most likely".

### Why the Tacoma Narrows Bridge Tore Itself Apart
https://youtu.be/qkzRUqlEy5I · 176 views · diagnosis: HEALTHY

- `REDESCRIBE` — no footage/source attribution; no technical references; no related-episode or playlist link (session growth); no synthetic-voice disclosure line
- Title to test later (as a logged experiment): "Filmed as It Fell: The Tacoma Narrows Collapse"

### Why San Francisco Burned for Three Days
https://youtu.be/X0jw78mIGdk · 113 views · diagnosis: INSUFFICIENT_DATA, WEAK_TOPIC_PACKAGING

- `REDESCRIBE` — no footage/source attribution; no technical references; no related-episode or playlist link (session growth); no synthetic-voice disclosure line
- `REVIEW_MANUALLY` — Published narration says the fire, not the quake, did most of the killing. Sources agree fire caused most of the DESTRUCTION; the split of deaths is uncertain. Clarify in the pinned comment/description rather than re-uploading.
- Title to test later (as a logged experiment): "No Water, Three Days of Fire: San Francisco 1906"

### The Nuclear Test That Poisoned a Paradise Forever
https://youtu.be/DLYpmaQ-EVw · 52 views · diagnosis: INSUFFICIENT_DATA, WEAK_TOPIC_PACKAGING

- `REDESCRIBE` — no footage/source attribution; no technical references; no related-episode or playlist link (session growth); no synthetic-voice disclosure line

## Order of work

1. **REDESCRIBE / ADD_INTERNAL_LINKS** first — objective gaps (sources, references, related links, disclosure), zero risk to CTR.
2. **PLAYLIST_MOVE** when a cluster reaches 3 published videos (`node channel-plan.js` shows status).
3. **RETITLE / RETHUMBNAIL** only after ~7 days of data, one video at a time, logged as an experiment.
4. **REPACKAGE** is reserved for videos with measured weak packaging (P1), never on day-one guesses.
